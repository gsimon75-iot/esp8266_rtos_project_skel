# A skeleton project for the ESP RTOS SDK

The goal is to have mock examples for
- project-scope include files
- additional literal data
- modules (now static, later can be git submodules)

I intend to use projects like this in a CI/CD pipeline (FIXME: under construction),
so building binaries will be triggered simply by pushing the code to git, and
the build farm can be easily scaled up if needed.
